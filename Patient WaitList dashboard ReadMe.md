# Power BI Project: Hospital Waitlist Analysis

This Power BI project analyzes hospital waitlists by age profile, specialty, and time bands to provide insights into patient management and wait times.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information on hospital specialties, case types, age profiles, and time bands for both inpatient and outpatient cases. Key columns include:

- **Archive_Date**: Date of the record.
- **Specialty_HIPE**: Numeric code for hospital specialties.
- **Specialty_Name**: Name of the specialty (e.g., Dermatology).
- **Case_Type**: Type of medical case (e.g., Day Case, Inpatient, Outpatient).

- **Total**: Total number of patients within each category.
- **Specialty Group**: Grouping of specialties (e.g., Respiratory, Heart).

## Key Insights & Visuals

The dashboard provides several key insights:
- **Waitlist Breakdown**: Divides patients by age profile, specialty, and time bands.
- **Time-Based Trends**: Displays patient counts across different months, highlighting trends in wait times.
- **Comparison of Inpatient and Outpatient Data**: Provides comparative insights into wait times for inpatient vs. outpatient cases.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Includes averages and medians for more detailed analysis.
